# safehax/safefirmhax
## What this is:

Basically, it works like Brahma's arm9 bootstrap, but for a wider range of firmwares. It will attempt to load one of the listed payloads from the SD card root: 

 * `safehaxpayload.bin`
 * `arm9.bin`
 * `arm9loaderhax.bin`

These files are ordered by load priority, so if `safehaxpayload.bin` is present it will not try and load either of the other payloads. After this, it'll load the payload it finds into memory @ 0x23F00000. This is useful for a number of things, including installing otpless arm9loaderhax on N3DS, dumping your nand on the newer firmwares, and running CFW.

A Kernel11 exploit must be run ahead of time that either enables all srv/svc access, or gives us the global svc 0x30 backdoor.

## How it works:

Because 'SAFE_MODE' firm is out of date (~3.0 on O3DS, ~8.1 on N3DS), it's still vulnerable to firmlaunch-hax, which allows us to overwrite the arm9 entry pointer on firmlaunch. Knowing this, we can trigger a firmlaunch, so that 'SAFE_MODE' arm9 can run, then we sync up with arm9 until we can send another firmlaunch request to it. From there, we can do firmlaunch-hax like normal and gain arm9 code execution.
